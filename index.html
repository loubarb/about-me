                I was born and raised in NYC where I still live today. After graduating from college, I realized my true passion fell in the field of technology. I then picked up a job as a Help Desk technician to fulfill my desire for PC building and troubleshooting.
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                After 4 years in the field, I was feeling a bit unsatisfied and wanting to do more with my career. I realized that while I loved the hardware side of things, my creative bug was not being fulfilled. I decided to then dive into the world of web development and I haven't looked back!
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                Outside of the tech industry, one of my biggest interests is music! While I don't actually create music, I always need to have it on in the background. It helps make the day go by and makes my daily tasks a lot more enjoyable. I am definitely a concert junkie and find myself at a show at least once per month!
